# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented in Python.

## How to Play

1. Run the `main.py` file.
2. Players take turns entering numbers from 1-9 to mark their spot on the board.
3. The first player to get three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins!
4. If all 9 squares are filled and no player has won, the game is a draw.
